Developer's documentation!
=================================

This documentation is designed for developers.  The documentation is highly technical, while it is actually quite interesting if you want to know how Red-R is working, the documentation might not be what general users are looking for.  If you think you are here by mistake you should go to the main table of contents and look at the user documentation.
