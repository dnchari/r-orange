Reads files from a text file and brings them into RedR.  These files should be like a table and should have values that are separated either by a tab, space, or comma.  You can use the scan feature to scan a small part of your data and make sure that it is in the correct format.  You can also set a column to represent the row names of your data.  This is encouraged if you have row names as some widgets rely on row names to help them function.
