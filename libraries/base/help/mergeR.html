<strong>Introduction<br></strong><br><br>Merges or subsets two datasets depending on options.<br><br><strong>Details</strong><br><br>Combining data from different tables is often required during data mining.  The Merge Data widget combines data in a variety of ways.<br><br>Once data is connected it is loaded into the appropriate channel and the names of the columns are shown in the selection list boxes under the headings 'Select Columns to Merge From A/B'.  The name Rownames will always be displayed in these for merging on rownames.  If there are two identically named columns in your data these will be the default merge columns on widget connect.  After selecting a column name or to merge using rownames your data will be merged and three data tables will be sent.  One with the merger of all of the data through the Merge_All slot, and two others with the merger on only one of the tables (ex. All rows from table A merged with the matching columns from table B).<br><br>Checking 'Force Merger' will activate the buttons beginning with 'Bind'.  Clicking on these will force merger of the columns or rows simply by the location in the table (ex. binding two tables each with 15 rows).<br><br>Clicking 'Always Merge Like This' will allow for continuous merger when new data is connected based on the criteria that you entered the first time you merged data.  If this is not checked you must press the 'Commit' button to commit your merger selections into the Red-R schema.
