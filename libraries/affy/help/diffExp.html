<strong>Introduaction</strong><br><br><strong></strong>Calculates differential expression of genes from an eSet object, or any data table.<br><br><strong>Details</strong><br><br>This widget makes comparisons across the parameters in the rows of a data table and returns a model fit that can be used in other widgets for selecting differentially valued parameters.  If no Class Manager object is detected in the received data then the basic start screen is shown.  This consists of three list boxes with the column names of the data displayed in the center.  This screen allows you to place the columns (samples) into either the box on the right or the one on the left (classes A and B).  Clicking a column name sets it into the box coresponding to the class that is displayed below the center list box (ex. Setting Class A).  Click the 'Switch Class' button to change to setting the other class.  Once you have populated the boxes with the desired columns click the 'Process eSet' button to commit your data into the Red-R schema.<br><br>If a Class Manager is detected the Formula Entry screen will be shown.  Using this you may generate a complex model design that can include interactions and multiple analyzes.   Once you have made your design click the 'Process eSet' button to commit your data into the Red-R schema.
