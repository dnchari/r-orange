<strong>Introduction</strong><br><br><strong></strong>Calculates differential expression of genes from an eSet object<br><br><strong>Details</strong><br><br>After making a model fit to your data this widget can be used to subset and compare groups based on the model.  This is the widget that will return examples or samples that are significantly different across your samples based on the parameters that you set in the widget dialog.<br><br>You may set the combine method and the p-value adjust methods using the respective combo boxes.  More information about what these parameters do can be found <a href="http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/limma/html/decideTests.html">here</a>.<br><br>If your model fit was generated using a complex design, for example one with interactions, then the 'Change Model Group Subset' button will be activated.  This button will allow you to subset your data on those genes that pass the model subset from any element in your design.  The first element is used by default.  Use Run Analysis to commit your data and send it into the Red-R schema.
